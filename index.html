  				IEEE Mentorship Program 2018
  			</h2>
  			<p>
  				The IEEE Mentorship Program is designed to connect 3rd year students with DJSCOE alumni, and they in turn pass on the knowledge to the 2nd year students. Allowing them the opportunity to gain valuable experience and advice for career development.
<br>
				The relationship between mentors and mentees is viewed as a partnership and the length of each Mentor match is approximately 6 months. The Mentorship Program is not intended as a job placement service for students, but is offered as a tool for students seeking career path advice from successful and experienced DJSCOE alumni.

  			IEEE Brainwaves yet again conducted
a successful seminar on how to crack
the civil services examinations which
was delivered by Mr. Prajit Nair ,IAS
officer. He is one of the elite alumni
of D.J.Sanghvi college of engineering
(electronics engineering, batch of
2012)who chose to forefront his
career towards civil services after his
graduation.
<br>
The seminar was attended by a lot of  IAS aspirants
 who wanted to get a clear sight of the overall examination
  process and learn the mantra of cracking the toughest examination. 
  IAS remains as the dream job for aspiring youngsters who desires to
   bring a positive change in the outlook of the Indian society.
   <br>
Mr. Prajit shared his experience of preparing for the examination and
 gave tips on how to prepare yourself for the various rounds of the
  examination process.
  He said that the exams consists of overall three stages: the prelims, the mains and the panel review stage.
  		The entire process of filling up the form, preparation, the exam and the results, takes about a year.

  			No CellPhone Day and Spanish Workshop

  		<p>
  			There are millions of cellphone users in
India, but on 6 th February, 2018 there were
a few less. The IEEE Brainwaves came up
with an experiment where the Third and
Second year students of the Electronics
department students would give up the use
of their Phones for a day. In exchange of
this, the students got to attend a Spanish
workshop and the rest of the normal
schedule was used to play some games.
As Margaret Heffernan once said, "The
cellphone has become the adult's
transitional object, replacing the toddler's
teddy bear for comfort and a sense of
belonging" the rather sad truth of our
times. This brings me to Behavioral
addiction; though not same as substance
addiction, there are a lot of similarities
between the two. Let's have a look at some
statistics,

In a study conducted by Baylor University,
cellphone addiction was linked to:<br>

  			About the visit:<br>
			The first Industrial visit by IEEE Brainwaves was to IIT Bombay; which is home to the first student satellite, Pratham. Pratham is an Indian ionospheric research satellite which is being operated by the Indian Institute of Technology.
			<br>
			<br>
			The Experience:<br>
			The visit to Pratham was a small endeavour, with only 40 students. However, the experience was truly enriching for all. The objective of the visit was to give the students a first-hand experience about the satellite and the entire venture from inception. A brief PowerPoint presentation gave the students an overview of the venture. The students were shown a live feed from Pratham. The students were then taken to the labs where all the testing and engineering had been done. This gave the students an insight into the decade long project that has been going on in IIT Bombay. All of this was then followed by a Q&A session. Each question reflected the keen curiosity of the students of DJ Sanghvi. The Q and A session thus marked the end of the IV.

The track consisted of different slopes and challenging obstacles to be driven on, for the participants. The entire track was designed and prepared by the IEEE tech-team with assistance from the SE Co-committee members. There were various checkpoints and each of them on completion earned the player a specific set of points. The fastest and the one earning most number of points was declared as the winner. The average of both time and earned points was used to determine the winner of the competition. The event was also promoted as a fun event. Anyone could play the entire track with the bots that were provided by the organisers. It was ensured that for the competition the participant had to register and get their self-designed bots.<br>
